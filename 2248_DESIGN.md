Design Document: 2248 Web Game
1. Overview
Create a browser-based puzzle game inspired by “2248.” Unlike sliding puzzles (such as 2048), players connect sequences of adjacent tiles with the same value. The connected tiles merge into a single tile with a larger value, typically the sum of the tiles. The game continues as new numbers appear, allowing the player to create larger chains and reach high scores.

2. Core Requirements
Grid-Based Board

Start with a larger board (e.g., 6×6 or configurable).

Each tile stores a numeric value (2, 4, 8, etc.).

Chain Merging Mechanic

Player can drag or click/tap to select a chain of adjacent tiles containing the same number.

The chain merges into one tile with the new value (e.g., three “4” tiles merge into a single “12” tile).

Random Tile Generation

After each chain merge, new tiles spawn at random empty locations.

Similar to addRandomTile() from the 2048 clone, but adapted to different spawn rules.

Score and Best Score

Add points equal to the resulting tile’s value each time a chain merges.

Use localStorage for storing best scores, reusing logic from lines 7–10 and 83–90 in game.js.

UI Elements

A grid displayed in index.html (similar structure as the existing board, but with dynamic size).

Buttons for “New Game,” “Undo,” and “Toggle Theme.”

Mobile-friendly drag gestures as well as mouse input.

Undo Functionality

Maintain a stack of previous states (similar to the previousStates logic with MAX_UNDO at line 1 and storage at lines 150–160).

Dark Mode

Reuse the approach in game.js lines 11–18 and CSS classes from styles.css to toggle a dark theme.

3. Architecture
3.1 Game State
Class: Game2248

size: grid size (e.g., 6).

grid: 2D array representing tile values.

score, bestScore: numeric scores.

previousStates: for undo capability.

isDarkMode: tracks theme preference.

Functions modeled on Game2048:

init() – resets the board (adapt from lines 22–42 of game.js).

addRandomTile() – spawn a number in a random empty cell (adapt from lines 44–63).

updateGrid() – update the DOM to reflect tile values (adapt from lines 66–80).

Input handling: replace arrow-key moves with drag-based chain detection.

3.2 Input Handling
Mouse/Touch:

Track pointer down/move/up events on the board.

Collect a list of cells visited during the drag. Only allow continuation if the next tile has the same value and is orthogonally adjacent.

On pointer up, merge the chain if length ≥ 2.

3.3 Chain Merging Logic
Validate that the chain consists of identical numbers.

Sum the values to produce a new number.

Replace the final tile in the chain with the new value; set other tiles to empty.

Animate the merge (similar to the tile-new and tile-merged CSS animations used in mergeTiles at lines 248–267).

3.4 Game Loop
After each merge:

Add random tiles.

Update the score.

Check for possible moves (game over condition: no possible chains or no empty cells).

Push state to the undo stack.

3.5 Rendering
HTML/CSS:

Update index.html to create a flexible grid container (use CSS Grid).

Generate tile elements in init() using a loop similar to lines 31–36 of game.js.

Use classes for tile colors, with dark mode overrides similar to styles.css lines 55–109.

3.6 Persistence and Settings
Use localStorage to remember:

Best score.

Theme preference (light/dark).

Optionally store grid size or other settings.

4. Development Tasks
Setup Project

Fork or copy the existing 2048 repository structure (HTML/CSS/JS).

Rename main script to game2248.js and modify index.html to load it.

Implement Game2248 Class

Initialize grid with configurable size.

Adapt methods from Game2048 for initialization and DOM rendering.

Replace arrow-key movement with chain selection/merging.

Input Handling

Create event listeners for pointer/touch events on tiles.

Manage a list of selected tiles during dragging.

Provide visual feedback for selected chains (e.g., highlight tiles).

Merge and Scoring

Implement chain-merge algorithm.

Update score based on resulting tile value.

Provide merge animations using CSS transitions or classes.

Game Over Check

Determine when no chains of length ≥2 are available and the board is full.

Display a game-over overlay similar to the one in showGameState (lines 324–339).

Undo Stack

Save board state before each merge (similar to logic at lines 150–160).

Limit the stack size to MAX_UNDO.

UI Enhancements

Reuse the existing styling and dark-mode support.

Ensure the grid scales correctly on both desktop and mobile.

5. Additional Features (Optional)
Power-Ups or Bonuses – e.g., clear a row, double score for a limited time.

Persistent Progress – store current game state in localStorage to resume after page reload.

Sound Effects – provide simple audio cues for merges and game-over.

Animations – additional effects for long chains.

6. Implementation Tips
Leverage Existing Code: The 2048 clone’s structure for board initialization (init()) and DOM manipulation (updateGrid()) can be reused with minor adjustments. Refer to lines 22–42 and 66–80 in game.js for guidance.

Modularize Logic: Separate chain-detection and merging logic into helper functions to keep handleInput() clean.

Testing and Debugging: Start with smaller grid sizes for debugging, then switch to the final size once core mechanics are stable.
